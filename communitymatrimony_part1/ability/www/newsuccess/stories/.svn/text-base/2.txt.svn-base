M418708|Erum Saeed|Fakhrul Khan|The Point Worth mentioning here is that Erum was my first search and we got engaged in my very first attempt. We contacted through services of Muslim Matrimony which enabled to get in touch with the bride's family in the most simplest way. I really thank MuslimMatrimony to a great extent for helping me find a very suitable partner in a the most easiest way. I wish MuslimMatrimony to continue their wonderful services for ever.
